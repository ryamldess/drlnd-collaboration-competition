# Project 3: Collaboration and Competition

### Introduction

This is my submission for Project 3 - Collaboration and Competition in the Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree.

### Getting Started

My submission includes the following files:

- Tennis.ipynb
- Soccer.ipynb
- This file, README.md
- Report.md
- DDPG.ddpg_classes.py, which contains all of my Python classes
- The final checkpoint_actor.pth and checkpoint_critic.pth files

You can simply run the last code cell in the notebook to execute my code; it contains all imports and other code necessary for the assignment.

1. I followed the instructions specified as far as downloading the DRLND repo.

2. I followed the instructions in the notebook to explore the environment provided.

### The Assignment

1. I reused the code from the last assignment, Project 2, with very trivial adjustments.

2. I attempted the extra credit assignment, and nearly finished, but ran into issues and ran out of time, so had to abandon it. I included a saved version of the notebook anyway.
